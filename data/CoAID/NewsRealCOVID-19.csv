the Twenty-Fourth IHR Emergency Committee""",the twenty fourth meeting of the emergency committee under the international health regulations 2005 ihr on the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the director general on 26 march 2020 with committee members only attending via teleconference supported by the who secretariat. in order to ease the burden on affected state parties in the exceptional situation following the determination of the covid-19 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern pheic on 30. ,the twenty fourth meeting of the emergency committee under the international health regulations 2005 ihr on the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the director general on 26 march 2020 with committee members only attending via teleconference supported by the who secretariat. in order to ease the burden on affected state parties in the exceptional situation following the determination of the covid-19 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern pheic on 30 january 2020 characterized as a pandemic on 11 march 2020 the invited state parties were asked to present their reports electronically only instead of attending via teleconference. reports were received from afghanistan burkina faso central african republic cote divoire democratic republic of congo dr congo ethiopia ghana pakistan and philippines. the emergency committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus wpv1 and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses cvdpv. the who secretariat presented a report of progress for affected ihr states parties subject to temporary recommendations. wild poliovirus the committee remains gravely concerned by the significant increase in wpv1 cases globally in 2019 and 2020 with 175 cases in 2019 compared to 33 in 2018 and already 32 cases as at 17 march 2020 compared to six for the same period in 2019 with no significant success yet in reversing this trend. in pakistan transmission continues to be widespread as indicated by both acute flaccid paralysis afp surveillance and environmental sampling. while the issues of vaccine hesitancy and refusals by individuals and communities and problems with management of the national polio program are being addressed these are yet to have impact on the current worrying epidemiology. the added pressure on the program due to detection of cvdpv2 and ongoing spread in several provinces see below has continued into 2020. in afghanistan the security situation remains very challenging. inaccessibility and missed children particularly in the southern region have led to a large cohort of susceptible children in this part of afghanistan. the risk of a major upsurge of cases is growing with other parts of the country that have been free of wpv1 for some time now at risk of outbreaks. this would again increase the risk of international spread. the committee noted that based on sequencing of viruses there were recent instances of international spread of viruses from pakistan to afghanistan and also from afghanistan to pakistan. the recent increased frequency of wpv1 international spread between the two countries suggests that rising transmission in pakistan and afghanistan correlates with increasing risk of wpv1 exportation beyond the single epidemiological block formed by the two countries. the committee noted the continued cooperation and coordination between afghanistan and pakistan particularly in reaching high risk mobile populations that frequently cross the international border and welcomed the all age vaccination now being taken at key border points between the two countries. vaccine derived poliovirus vdpv the multiple cirulating vdpv cvdpv outbreaks in four who regions african eastern mediterranean south east asian and western pacific regions are very concerning with two new countries reporting outbreaks since the last meeting malaysia and burkina faso. unlike historical experience cross border spread of cvdpv2 has become quite common with recent spread from angola to dr congo and zambia and from chad and car to cameroon and from ghana to burkina faso. in addition local emergences attributable to mopv2 use have recently occurred in togo chad and ethiopia. the committee noted that the gpei has published a strategy to address cvdpv2 outbreaks but was extremely concerned that the monovalent opv2 stockpile was still depleted. the committee strongly supports the development and proposed emergency use listing of the novel opv2 vaccine which should become available mid-2020 and which it is hoped will result in no or very little seeding of further outbreaks. impact of covid-19 the committee noted the very recent policy guidance of the gpei gpei recommendations for countries during the covid-19 pandemic. this document summarizes the recommendations from the polio oversight board meeting on 24 march 2020 which calls for postponement of both preventive and outbreak response campaigns while ensuring surveillance and nopv2 development and roll out plans continue in full. the covid-19 polio programme continuity plan. the operational guide was developed in collaboration with the regional polio eradication teams and the gpei partners to ensure essential gpei functions continue polio programme personnel and staff are kept safe and to plan for a fast and effective resumption of polio eradication activities including supplementary immunization activities as soon as the public health situation with covid-19 allows. the committee is extremely concerned about the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the risk of heightened transmission of polio and consequently the potential for international spread and significant reversal of polio eradication. conclusion the committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a public health emergency of international concern pheic and recommended the extension of temporary recommendations for a further three months. however noting that some if not many international borders are closed to prevent international spread of covid-19 state parties may not currently be able to enforce the temporary recommendations in all places. the committee strongly urges countries subject to these recommendations to maintain a high state of readiness to implement them as soon as possible ensuring the continued safety of travelers as well as health professionals. the committee recognizes the concerns regarding the lengthy duration of the polio pheic but concludes that the current situation is extraordinary with clear ongoing risk of international spread and ongoing need for coordinated international response. the committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion rising risk of wpv1 international spread the progress made in recent years appears to have reversed with the committees assessment that the risk of international spread is at the highest point since 2014 when the pheic was declared. this risk assessment is based on the following the wpv1 exportation in 2019 from pakistan to iran and to afghanistan and more recently spread from afghanistan to pakistan;ongoing rise in the number of wpv1 cases and positive environmental samples in pakistan and to a lesser extent afghanistan;the quickly increasing cohort of unvaccinated children in afghanistan with the risk of a major outbreak imminent if nothing is done to access these children;the urgent need to overhaul the leadership and strategy of the program in pakistan which although already commenced is likely take some time to lead to more effective control of transmission and ultimately eradication;increasing community and individual resistance to the polio program.rising risk of cvdpv international spread the clearly documented increased spread in recent months of cvdpv2 demonstrate the unusual nature of the current situation as international spread of cvdpv in the past has been very infrequent. the number of new emergences of cvdpv2 in africa raises further concern. the risk of new outbreaks in new countries is considered extremely high even probable. covid-19 this new and unprecedented pandemic is likely to substantially negatively impact the polio eradication program and outbreak control efforts. there is a risk of exportation of both wpv1 and cvdpv to known high risk countries to which it may take a lot of time and effort to adequately respond.falling pv2 immunity global population mucosal immunity to type 2 polioviruses pv2 continues to fall as the cohort of children born after opv2 withdrawal grows exacerbated by poor coverage with ipv particularly in some of the cvdpv infected countries.multiple outbreaks the evolving and unusual epidemiology resulting in rapid emergence and evolution of cvdpv2 strains is extraordinary and not yet fully understood and represents an additional risk that is yet to be quantified.weak routine immunization many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by various humanitarian emergencies including covid19 and the number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses a growing risk leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to outbreaks of polio. surveillance gaps the appearance of highly diverged vdpvs in the philippines somalia and indonesia are examples of inadequate polio surveillance heightening concerns that transmission could be missed in various countries. furthermore the missed transmission in china for a year illustrates that even countries with generally good surveillance can miss vdpv transmission. covid-19 is likely to have a negative impact on polio surveillance also.lack of access inaccessibility continues to be a major risk particularly in several countries currently infected with wpv or cvdpv i.e. afghanistan nigeria niger somalia and myanmar which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.population movement the risk is amplified by population movement whether for family social economic or cultural reasons or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. there is a need for international coordination to address these risks. a regional approach and strong crossborder cooperation is required to respond to these risks as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders.risk categoriesthe committee provided the director general with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of wpv1 and cvdpvs based on the risk stratification as follows states infected with wpv1 cvdpv1 or cvdpv3 with potential risk of international spread.states infected with cvdpv2 with potential risk of international spread.states no longer infected by wpv1 or cvdpv but which remain vulnerable to re infection by wpv or cvdpv.criteria to assess states as no longer infected by wpv1 or cvdpv poliovirus case 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case plus one month to account for case detection investigation laboratory testing and reporting period or when all reported afp cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for wpv1 or cvdpv and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative whichever is the longer.environmental or other isolation of wpv1 or cvdpv no poliovirus case 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample such as from a healthy child plus one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting periodthese criteria may be varied for the endemic countries where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps e.g. borno state nigeria)once a country meets these criteria as no longer infected the country will be considered vulnerable for a further 12 months. after this period the country will no longer be subject to temporary recommendations unless the committee has concerns based on the final report.

preventive treatment.a quarter of the worlds population is estimated to be infected with tb bacteria. these people are neither sick nor contagious. however they are at greater risk of developing tb disease especially those with weakened immunity. offering them tb preventive treatment will not only protect them from becoming sick but also cut down on the risk of transmission in the community. as we mark world tb day 2020 the disease remains the worlds top infectious killer. in 2018 10 million people fell ill with tb worldwide and 1.5 million people lost their lives to this disease. covid-19 is highlighting just how vulnerable people with lung diseases and weakened immune systems can be said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general. the world committed to end tb by 2030 improving prevention is key to making this happen. millions of people need to be able to take tb preventive treatment to stop the onset of disease avert suffering and save lives"".dr tedros highlighted the importance to continue efforts to tackle longstanding health problems including tbduring global outbreaks such as covid-19. at the same time programmes already in place to combat tb and other major infectious diseases can be leveraged to make the response to covid-19 more effective and rapid.although some progress has been made towards targets set at the un high level meeting on tb in 2018 tb preventive treatment has been largely neglected. global leaders committed to ensuring access to tb preventive treatment to at least 24 million contacts of people with active tb and 6 million people living with hiv by 2022. to date only a fraction of that target has been reached with countries putting less than 430,000 contacts and 1.8 million people on tb preventive treatment in 2018. tb remains the top cause of death among people with hiv. tb preventive treatment works synergistically with antiretroviral therapy to prevent tb and save lives. reinvigorated efforts by governments health services partners donors and civil society will be needed to increase access to tb preventive treatment to the levels targeted. the new consolidated guidelines recommend a range of innovative approaches to scale up access to tb preventive treatment who recommends a scale up of tb preventive treatment among populations at highest risk including household contacts of tb patients people living with hiv and other people at risk with lowered immunity or living in crowded settings. who recommends an integration of tb preventive treatment services into ongoing case finding efforts for active tb. all household contacts of tb patients and people living with hiv are recommended to be screened for active tb. if active tb is ruled out they should be initiated on tb preventive treatment. who recommends that either a tuberculin skin test or interferon gamma release assay igra be used to test for tb infection. both tests are helpful to find people more likely to benefit from tb preventive treatment but should not become a barrier to scale up access. testing for tb infection is not required before starting tb preventive treatment in people living with hiv and children under 5 years who are contacts of people with active tb.who recommends new shorter options for preventive treatment in addition to the widely used 6 months of daily isoniazid. the shorter options that are now recommended range from a 1 month daily regimen of rifapentine plus isoniazid to 3 months weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid 3 months daily rifampicin plus isoniazid or 4 months of daily rifampicin alone.as people around the globe come together to commemorate world tb day who is calling on governments affected communities civil society organizations health care providers donors partners and the industry to unite forces and step up the tb response notably for tb preventive treatment to ensure no one is left behind said dr tereza kasaeva director of who s global tb programme. the new who guidance shows the way forward for millions to rapidly access new tools and shorter safer options for preventive treatment. the time for action is now. tb preventive treatment is an affordable intervention that can prevent families from sliding into poverty and preserve the health and economy of whole communities. who anticipates that as new and safer drugs come onto the markets and as prices fall it will become a highly cost effective way to save millions of lives. notes for editors work by who and partnerswho works closely with member states including the us government and technical and funding partners such as unitaid to enhance access to shorter tb preventive treatment regimens. unitaid supported projects such as impaact4 tb and cap tb projects enabled by who with partners in brazil cambodia cameroon cte divoire democratic republic of congo ethiopia ghana india indonesia kenya lesotho malawi mozambique south africa uganda united republic of tanzania and zimbabwe are leading the way. the new treatment options are also now more affordable thanks to the significant price drop of rifapentine a key drug facilitated recently by unitaid the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria and global biopharmaceutical company sanofi along with forthcoming arrangements underway with generic manufacturers. more about the guidelinesthe new consolidated who guidelines come with an operational handbook to help guide countries step by step as they take tb preventive treatment to scale. this includes guidance on how to prioritize and invest from demand creation for tb prevention to supervision and monitoring of the programme. the guidelines and operational handbook are also accompanied by an innovative mobile application prevent tb to help health care workers manage tb preventive treatment in their communities. its online dashboard allows programme managers to visualize and monitor data in real time. the application can be customized by countries to suit their specific settings and is currently being adopted in india and philippines. world tb daythe new guidelines and tools are being released ahead of world tb day. world tb day is
