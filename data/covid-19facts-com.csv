0,Are children less likely to catch the virus that causes COVID-19 than adults?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84630,The Guardian reports that children were half as likely to catch the virus and were the ‘safest group’ to be out in the community. This follows the preliminary findings of a systematic review by researchers from University College London that is currently awaiting peer-review and publication.,"The WHO advises that people of any age group can catch COVID-19. However, children and adolescents are understood to be less likely to get a severe infection. WHO also advises that young people can still transmit the infection to others, even if they have only mild symptoms and do not feel ill themselves."
1,Social distancing: Two metres safer than one,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84619,The media have reported on a systematic review published in The Lancet funded by the WHO.,"The UK government advises that people should stay 2 metres apart from anyone outside of their household. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advice is similar, suggesting a 6 foot distance (about 1.8 metres). The WHO recommends staying at least 1 metre apart."
2,Does mouth washing protect people from COVID-19?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84583,"Several media articles have reported on the Cardiff researchers’ call for testing mouthwashes on SARS-CoV-2. Suggestions that rinsing or gargling could help against the virus have been circulating for some time. In countries where rinsing with saline or mouthwash is part of the usual hygiene (such as Japan), it is a recommended preventive measure against respiratory disease.","Gargling is not currently recommended to protect against COVID-19. Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health says: “There is no evidence that regularly gargling [saltwater or saline] has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. While this may help soothe a sore throat, this practice will not prevent the virus from entering your lungs.”"
3,Will people take months to recover from symptoms of COVID-19?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84577,"Several media sites have carried stories about a doctor who has himself experienced long-lasting symptoms, and from a researcher who says his ongoing study shows “about 10%” of people experience symptoms for at least 25 days.",There is no information from the WHO or NHS about how long people are likely to experience symptoms of COVID-19.
4,How dangerous is COVID-19 for people with diabetes?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84571,"News that people with diabetes are at raised risk of death from COVID-19 has been circulating for a while. Recently, news reports focused on research from NHS England, which published two studies on the topic on 19 May.","The charity Diabetes UK said: “Although this new data has provided us with a lot more detail about the potential risks of coronavirus infection for people with diabetes, it is important to recognise that the risk of death from coronavirus remains very low for people with and without diabetes and that it will continue to decrease as the number of cases fall.”"
5,How widespread is coronavirus in a national population?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84564,"The initial results of the ongoing ONS study (which gave a slightly higher figure of 0.27% of the population currently infected) were covered by BBC News, among others. Their head of statistics said that the figure might seem “surprisingly small”. However, he pointed out that 0.27% amounted to about 150,000 people in England.","Martin Hibberd, Professor of Emerging Infectious Disease at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said via the Science Media Centre: “The release of this data is a welcome step forward in understanding the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Going forward this will allow us to track a population-based estimate of the number of cases.”"
6,Are COVID patients at risk of abnormal blood clotting?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84557,"Science News reported on the study, which was led by researchers from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and St James’ Hospital, Trinity College Dublin, and published last month in the British Journal of Haematology.","The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis has issued guidance on regulation and management of clotting disorders in COVID-19. This highlights the evidence linking raised D-dimer levels with increased mortality. Measurement of D-dimer and other blood clotting markers is recommended on admission, with continued daily monitoring to assess the need for more intensive management."
7,How many people recover after intensive care for COVID-19?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84550,"A report on the news website Bloomberg initially said that 88% of people put on ventilators in intensive care in the New York area died. However, this was based on a misunderstanding in the research. Only 3% had recovered and been discharged, 24.5% had died, but most (72%) remained in hospital.","The WHO and NHS have not yet commented on the survival rates for people with COVID-19 given mechanical ventilation. However, in the last month or more, many clinical guidelines have been published rapidly to inform those responsible for clinical care."
8,How many people with coronavirus do not have symptoms?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84544,"The BMJ reported the Chinese figures in a news story, based on figures published in China from April 1. The news story said: “A total of 130 of 166 new infections (78%) identified in the 24 hours to the afternoon of Wednesday 1st April were asymptomatic, said China’s National Health Commission.”",The Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine researchers concluded: “between 5% and 80% of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 may be asymptomatic” and that symptom-based screening will miss many people.
9,Is the coronavirus mutating to spread more effectively in humans?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84539,Several media outlets including the UK’s Independent recently reported on this study from researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The researchers posted a preliminary summary of their results online to allow other researchers to read them and give feedback. The results will undergo more quality checking once they are sent to a journal for publication.,"Changes to the coronavirus genetic code are important as they may change how well we are able to detect, prevent or treat it. As such, a lot of research is ongoing worldwide to collect, share and analyse genetic information on the virus."
10,Can running be safe?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84532,"The Sun was among media sources to display the animation of droplet transmission, which they described as a ‘horrific video.’  The video itself was reportedly produced by Ansys, a US-based technology company.","The WHO  advises that COVID-19 is spread primarily through ‘small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes or speaks… These droplets are relatively heavy, do not travel far and quickly sink to the ground… This is why it is important to stay at least 1 metre away from others.’"
11,Can you catch coronavirus in swimming pools?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84454,"The Sun reported that scientists in Spain were conducting research to see whether the virus could be passed on in swimming pools, beaches or the sea, ahead of the summer tourist season.","The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says: “There is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, spas or water play areas. Proper operation and maintenance (including disinfection with chlorine and bromine) of these facilities should inactivate the virus in the water.” They also advise that the salt in the sea and dilution effects make it unlikely the virus would survive."
12,Will COVID-19 become a seasonal disease like the flu?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84419,"Several media outlets reported a briefing given by Chinese scientists on 27 April, where Jin Qi, director of the Institute of Pathogen Biology at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, said: “This is very likely to be an epidemic that co-exists with humans for a long time, becomes seasonal and is sustained within human bodies.”",There is currently no advice for the public about how to prepare for winter outbreaks in the northern hemisphere. Though it is possible that other countries will have data to inform us soon.
13,Are COVID-19 patients dying silently of low blood oxygen levels?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84411,"The phenomenon of silent hypoxia or hypoxaemia was first reported in studies from China, although the studies did not indicate how common this was. It has since been noticed by doctors in the UK and other European countries.","The WHO advises that ‘if you have minor symptoms, such as only a slight cough or a mild fever, ‘there is generally no need to seek medical care’. They advise such people to stay at home, monitor their symptoms, and follow national guidance on self-isolation."
14,Is DNA responsible for young adults dying of coronavirus?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84406,The Mail Online is amongst the media outlets to have published an article reporting that there may be a link between healthy young people getting severely ill and dying of coronavirus and their DNA. It reports CDC data that suggests that nearly 40% of hospitalized coronavirus patients are young or middle-aged adults.,"As yet we don’t have the answers about how a person’s DNA might influence their susceptibility to coronavirus, and how severely they are affected if they do catch it. However, it is plausible that there is a link, and many international groups are coming together to study the possibility in the hope that it will help us to defeat the disease."
15,Are children with COVID-19 at risk of a severe inflammatory reaction?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84396,"The Guardian in the UK are among media outlets to have reported on this ‘unusual syndrome’ saying that 19 children in the UK had been affected as of the end of April 2020, but there had been no deaths. They said that cases were also being investigated in the US, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland.",The UK’s Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has issued guidance for doctors on what to look for and how to manage this paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19.
16,Are people with obesity at more risk from COVID-19?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84391,The Daily Mail reported that health secretary Matt Hancock had ordered an investigation into links between deaths from COVID-19 and obesity. The review will also look at factors such as ethnic background and sex. The Financial Times said that links between obesity and COVID-19 highlighted the impact of health inequalities in the UK.,The NHS website says that people are at high risk after contracting the coronavirus if they are “very obese (a BMI of 40 or above)” and that these people should only leave their home if essential to buy food and medicine.
17,Does coronavirus affect men and women differently?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84377,Reports from around the world began to emerge in mid-March to suggest that men were more likely to get seriously ill and die if they were infected with the coronavirus.,Neither the World Health Organisation nor the NHS website has any information about whether COVID-19 affects men and women differently.
18,Myth: The virus that causes COVID-19 is just a mutated version of the common cold,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84367,"The myth was reported on the website Medical News Today, which set out to debunk the assertion that “SARS-Cov-2 is just a mutated form of the common cold.” It is unclear where the myth originated.","The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says: “The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.”"
19,Myth: Coronavirus can only be caught directly from infected people,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84335,The systematic review on persistence of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces was published in February 2020 in The Journal of Hospital Infection.,"The WHO advises cleaning hands frequently and thoroughly, using soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitisers as the best way to protect yourself and others against COVID-19. They also advise that handwashing gives you more protection than wearing gloves, as you can still contaminate the gloves, and then transfer this contamination to your face."
20,Is there a “gastric coronavirus”?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84326,Several sources have reported on the possibility of gastric symptoms in the coronavirus. One author and historian has reported in the UK media the gastric symptoms she experienced.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) says: “The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, sore throat or diarrhoea.” It does not mention “gastric coronavirus”."
21,Are rashes or chilblains signs of coronavirus infection?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84323,"Several newspapers and magazines have reported that rashes, spots or chilblains might be symptoms of COVID-19. The Daily Express reported a letter to the Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology, from the French union of dermatologists. They had created a WhatsApp group of 400 dermatologists to share information about COVID-19, such as practice changes and use of telemedicine. Most posts covered skin symptoms that may be associated with the virus.","The World Health Organisation currently advises: “The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough and tiredness. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, sore throat or diarrhoea.” Potential skin symptoms are also not reported by UK government sources or the US Center for Disease Control. However, as above, the CDC advises that people seek medical attention “for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.”"
22,Myth: Hand-dryers kill the coronavirus,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84292,"Some media outlets report that there have been rumours that a 30-second blast from a hand drier can kill coronavirus. Other reports refer to a (now removed) video that apparently circulated on social media, in which using hot air dryers to blast hot air into the mouth and nose is recommended to kill the virus.","The WHO says: “Hand dryers are not effective in killing the [novel coronavirus]. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly using paper towels or a warm air dryer.”"
23,Are patients left with poor lung function after COVID-19?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84191,"The medical director of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority’s Infection Disease Centre reported the observations for 12 patients at a press conference in early March 2020. The current summary is based on a briefing by Business Insider, Australia. The findings were said to be first publicized in the South China Morning Post.","The WHO reports that around 80% of people infected will experience mild symptoms and recover without treatment, while it is thought that some may remain completely asymptomatic. However, 1 in 6 people may develop breathing complications. People with existing health problems like respiratory or cardiovascular disease are expected to be at higher risk."
24,Does the coronavirus affect male fertility?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84157,"In March the Mail Online reported that a Professor in reproductive medicine from Wuhan suggested that coronavirus could affect the testes and that men who have had it should have fertility tests after recovery. The South China Morning Post reported that a similar report was published on the Hubei government website and widely shared on social media, before being removed.","As of the 23rd April, specific advice on coronavirus and male fertility had not been issued by sources such as the UK’s Human Fertilisation & Embryology Authority, the British Fertility Society, or the American Society for Reproductive Medicine."
25,Myth: The melanin skin pigment can protect against the coronavirus,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84151,"The myth appears to have started after a young Cameroonian student in China contracted the virus. Some African news outlets said doctors were surprised that he had survived and put it down to his genes. As he was young, there’s nothing surprising about it. His ethnic background is unlikely to have anything to do with his survival.",The myth has been debunked by organisations including the World Economic Forum and Reuters news agency. The World Economic Forum says: “There is no proof that melanin protects black people from the coronavirus. There is also no scientific evidence that African blood composition prevents Africans from contracting the coronavirus.”
26,Are smokers more likely to catch coronavirus?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84134,"The Sun’s article is based on a Public Health England (PHE) warning to smokers that they are more likely to suffer severe disease from coronavirus. Unfortunately, the Sun’s headline misreports the basis for this warning, as the research in question didn’t find that smokers are more likely to get coronavirus. Instead, it found that smokers were more likely to develop more serious COVID-19 disease.",The World Health Organization says: “Smokers are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 as the act of smoking means that fingers (and possibly contaminated cigarettes) are in contact with lips which increases the possibility of transmission of virus from hand to mouth.
27,Myth: Mosquitos can spread coronavirus,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84126,The claim was originally published on Facebook but seems to have since been removed. It has also surfaced on a variety of other social media platforms as people speculated about where this new infection could have come from and how it could be spread.,The World Health Organisation is quite clear that there is no evidence to date suggesting mosquitos can transmit coronavirus. It says infected droplets from the mouths and noses of people suffering the disease are the key route of transmission and reiterates the recommendation that frequent hand washing is the best way to protect oneself against it.
28,Myth: Spraying yourself with chlorine or bleach can protect against coronavirus,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84120,"It is unclear where the story originated. However, one widespread news report showed officials apparently spraying a mixture of chlorine and water over a group of migrant workers in Uttar Pradesh, India. The local government later blamed “overzealous” officials.","The World Health Organization says: “Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations.”"
29,Myth: Antibiotics are already available to treat COVID-19,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84061,"The Mail Online reported that “a team of researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology” had said that four antibiotics could “stop the virus” in laboratory tests. The study itself, however, reported that the drugs have not been directly tested against the virus that causes COVID-19.","The World Health Organization says: “Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and therefore antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment."
30,Myth: Red eyes mean you have coronavirus,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84050,"The Mail Online story was based on an interview with a nurse treating patients at a care home in Washington State broadcast by CNN on March 24. The nurse said: “It’s something that I witnessed in all of them (the patients). They have, like … allergy eyes.”","The NHS continues to state that symptoms of coronavirus infection to look out for are a high temperature and a new, continuous cough. The World Health Organization says: “The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhoea.”"
31,Myth: Vaccination against pneumonia might protect you from coronavirus,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84042,"This claim has been swirling around for some weeks on social media and chat forums. Recently an American specialist in children’s infectious diseases discussed the claim on a YouTube video. She says we don’t yet know if it could help prevent complications of coronavirus, but that older people who would usually get the vaccine should continue to do so.","The World Health Organization states clearly that vaccines against pneumonia don’t protect against COVID-19. It points out that this infection is completely new, and needs a completely novel type of vaccine. Urgent research work is underway to find one."
32,Does air pollution increase deaths from COVID-19?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84038,"The Guardian and several other media outlets reported the study, which was released on the 5th April by the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. Prior to this report, the European Public Health Alliance warned in March that air pollution was likely to increase complications or deaths from COVID-19.","The WHO has not commented on links between air pollution and COVID-19 deaths. However, in 2014 the organisation said that air pollution may cause 7 million premature deaths annually worldwide, contributing to deaths from cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease (including acute respiratory infections such as SARS and COVID-19) and cancer."
33,Myth: 5G is causing the coronavirus pandemic,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84010,The Sun reported that there are posts on YouTube misinforming people that 5G WiFi is causing the coronavirus outbreak.,"The WHO state that to date “no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies” although “so far, only a few studies have been carried out at the frequencies to be used by 5G.” They add that no consequences for public health are anticipated from these frequencies."
34,Does losing your sense of smell mean you have coronavirus?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84002,"There has been widespread media coverage of claims that loss of smell or taste is signs of coronavirus infection. Many of these reported a statement from ENT UK, a professional body representing doctors working in ear, nose and throat specialities in the UK. The statement discussed the evidence and suggested that patients with loss of smell could also be asked to self-isolate.","The World Health Organization says: “The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhoea.” Loss of smell is not mentioned."
35,"Myth: Drinking hot water, or gargling, can prevent coronavirus infection",https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83990,The New York Times reported that there are many posts on social media asking about gargling as a protective measure.,"Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health says: “There is no evidence that regularly gargling has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. While this may help soothe a sore throat, this practice will not prevent the virus from entering your lungs—neither will drinking frequent sips of water.”"
36,Myth: Taking a sauna or hot bath can kill coronavirus,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83981,Some sauna manufacturers have made claims that saunas can protect against COVID-19. Manufacturers are unlikely to be reliable sources of information as they have a vested interest in persuading people of the benefits.,"The World Health Organisation says: “Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you.”"
37,Are you at risk of catching coronavirus from handling home deliveries?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83945,"Since the start of the novel coronavirus outbreak people have been concerned about the risks from packages. Initially concerns centred on packages coming from areas where the infection had first taken hold such as China, but as the virus is now more widespread so are the concerns.","The WHO reports that studies suggest that coronaviruses may persist on surfaces for between a few hours and several days, and that this may vary based on factors like the type of surface, or temperature and humidity of the environment. They say that there is both a low chance of commercial goods being contaminated by an infected person and or catching the virus off of a package that has been moved, travelled, and been exposed to different conditions and temperature."
38,Do people with blood group A have a higher risk of coronavirus infection?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83917,"The story first surfaced in the South China Morning Post, which reported on 17 March that “People with blood type A may be more vulnerable to infection by the new coronavirus, while those with type O seem more resistant.”",The WHO and NHS have not commented on the paper.
39,Myth: Anti-malarial drugs can cure coronavirus,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83912,"There have been widespread reports in the media and social media about chloroquine being effective against coronavirus. It makes sense to trial existing drugs, which have been used for other conditions, when looking for ways to treat new viruses.","The World Health Organisation’s guidance on management of COVID-19 says that there is no current evidence to recommend any specific anti-COVID-19 treatment for patients with confirmed COVID-19. It recommends investigational anti-COVID-19 therapeutics are used in ethically approved, randomised, controlled trials."
40,Is breastfeeding safe?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83878,"Many news articles have covered the risks of coronavirus in pregnancy, questioning whether pregnant women are at greater risk of catching the disease or being more severely affected and whether breastfeeding is safe for the babies of mothers with the infection.","UK guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists (RCOG) says that women with coronavirus can breastfeed. It says that there is no evidence showing that the virus can be carried in breastmilk, and the well-recognised benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of coronavirus through breastmilk."
41,Myth: The coronavirus pandemic will slow down this summer because of the heat,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83865,Multiple social media sources accounts and commentators have amplified this story in both positive and negative ways.,"The World Health Organization noted that the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in all areas, including those with hot and humid weather."
42,Myth: Pet cats and dogs are spreading coronavirus,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83860,"At the end of February, the Hong Kong government’s Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department reported that the pet dog of a patient with COVID-19 had tested positive for coronavirus in Hong Kong. This prompted questions about whether pets could be spreading the virus, and whether they should be put into quarantine.","The WHO says: “While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19.”"
43,Can you catch coronavirus twice?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83849,"In February a Japanese woman who had recovered from COVID-19 and tested negative for the virus, developed symptoms and tested positive again about 20 days later. China has also reportedly had similar cases. These cases led to people questioning whether it was possible to get the novel coronavirus twice.","The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say that the immune response to the novel coronavirus is not yet understood. They say that people who caught the coronavirus that causes MERS were unlikely to be re-infected shortly after recovery, but that it is not yet known whether similar immune protection will be observed for patients with COVID-19."
44,Myth: A vaccine is likely to be ready within the next month or so,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83775,"In Beijing, the director of the National Health Commission’s Science and Technology Development Centre claimed in the South China Morning Post that a coronavirus vaccine will be ready next month. He said it is to be used for emergency situations and clinical trials, and eight institutes in China are working on different approaches to fight COVID-19. Sometime in April they hope to have the vaccine available.","A recent overview from the University of Pennsylvania looked at the complexity and costs of vaccine manufacturing and it suggests that the regulatory requirements can be challenging for the vaccine manufacture industry. The steps that are necessary to produce a vaccine that is ‘safe, effective and consistent’ are difficult to execute over the life cycle of a vaccine."
45,Do reusable water bottles spread the virus?,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83769,"Heightened awareness of hygiene and risk of coronavirus has led people to question the cleanliness and hygiene of a range of places and objects, including cash, gyms and re-useable water bottles.",The major public health bodies such as the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have not specifically produced guidance on reusable water bottles during the coronavirus outbreak.
46,Myth: Airport temperature screening for arriving passengers can ‘stop’ coronavirus,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83757,"Some countries have restricted entry from the countries which are badly affected by COVID-19. Other countries have started using screening measures on entry such as temperature screening for passengers arriving from high risk countries. In Wuhan, where the outbreak began, airport temperature screening was also used in the early stages to stop infected passengers leaving the area.","The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has stated that “There is evidence that checking people at the airport (known as entry screening) is not very effective in preventing the spread of the virus, especially when people do not have symptoms. It is generally considered more useful to provide those arriving at airports with clear information explaining what to do if they develop symptoms after arrival.”"
47,Myth: Mutations making coronavirus “more aggressive”,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83749,"Many news sources have covered the findings of this study by researchers from Peking University and other centres in China. For example, the Sun headline was that “Coronavirus has ‘mutated’ into TWO strains – with the most aggressive infecting 70% of patients, scientists claim”.","The researchers themselves say that it is not clear whether the L type causes more severe disease (“is more virulent”) than the S type. As yet we have very limited information on the genetics of the circulating viruses, and how genetic variations might impact severity or infectiousness in humans, or in cells or animals in the laboratory."
48,Myth: Coronavirus is no worse than the flu,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83734,Many mainstream and social media have covered the question of mortality recently including health sites and newspapers. It is well known that “fear stories” in headlines can sell newspapers.,"Seasonal influenza, pandemic flu (such as H1N1) and SARS, another coronavirus, are natural comparators for these outbreaks, but they are all different diseases with different case fatality rates and profiles."
49,Myth: Children are “safe” from coronavirus,https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83720,"All parents know that infections such as the winter vomiting bug (norovirus) or chickenpox can spread like wildfire through nurseries and schools. Therefore the obvious concern with a new virus, like the one that causes COVID-19, is that children could be more susceptible. However, more recent news has suggested that children may be “safe” from coronavirus.","The initial research findings have allayed some fears about COVID-19 in children. However, there is still much we don’t know, and children cannot be ignored in preventive measures or planning for combating the disease."
