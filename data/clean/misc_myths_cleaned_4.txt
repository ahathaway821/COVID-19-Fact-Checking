Johns Hopkins Medicine	FALSE	FALSE	You can get a face mask exemption card so you don t need to wear a mask.	Fake cards and flyers, claiming that the bearer is exempt from mask-wearing regulations, have shown up in some areas. The cards, which some people have purchased online, may have official-looking logos or government insignias on them. They claim that the person carrying them has a physical or mental condition covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that makes them unable to wear a face mask or covering. The United States Department of Justice has issued a statement about these fake mask exemptions, explaining that these cards and flyers are fraudulent.  People have tried to use the fake cards to avoid having to wear a mask in public places that require them, such as some stores and restaurants. The cards are not issued by the U.S. government and are not backed by the ADA	2020-07-18	https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/2019-novel-coronavirus-myth-versus-fact
Johns Hopkins Medicine		FALSE	You can protect yourself from COVID-19 by injecting, swallowing, bathing in or rubbing onto your body bleach, disinfectants or rubbing alcohols.	These products are highly toxic and should never be swallowed or injected into the body. Call 911 if this occurs.Disinfectants, bleach and soap and water may be used to clean surfaces, an important prevention step in stopping the spread of coronavirus and COVID-19 � the disease caused by the coronavirus that�s led to the global pandemic. Never attempt to self-treat or prevent COVID-19 by rubbing or bathing with bleach, disinfectants or rubbing alcohol anywhere on your body.

www.covid-19facts.com		TRUE	Antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 start to drop within three weeks of infection, research from China suggests	It had been hoped that people who�d had COVID-19 might develop long-term immunity to further infection. However, studies looking at the levels of IgG antibodies, the type of antibodies that contribute to immunity, suggest this may not be the case. Researchers studied 1,500 people admitted to hospitals in China with confirmed COVID-19 infection. These patients had antibody tests at least 21 days after admission. Almost 1 in 10 had no detectable IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus when tested. Another study of 37 people with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test but no symptoms, found that 40% had no detectable IgG antibodies two months after the infection. The findings suggest that many people who recover from COVID-19 may still develop long-term immunity, but a few could remain vulnerable to future infection. Vaccines train the immune system to recognise the virus and are thought, potentially, to confer longer-lasting immunity. So, these data boosts the hunt for a safe and effective vaccine.	2020-07-08	https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84747

www.covid-19facts.com		TRUE	the risk of catching something airborne on a plane is lower than in many other confined spaces because of the filters and air exchanges	On most commercial aircraft, air is circulated through hospital-grade HEPA filters (High-Efficiency Particle Filters), which remove 99 percent of bacteria, as well as the airborne particles that carry viruses (Droplets etc). On modern aircraft, there are changes in the air system approximately 15 to 30 times per hour, or once every two to four minutes, which is far more frequent than in offices, movie theatres, or classrooms.	2020-05-14	https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84442
www.covid-19facts.com		TRUE	For germs to be passed from person to person through coughs and sneezes in airplanes, one needs to be sitting very close to a sick passenger, usually within two rows and for a long period of time to increase the chances of contracting an illness	It should be noted that one drawback of air quality is its dryness. Air is relatively dry with around 12 percent humidity. This is chiefly a by-product of cruising at high-altitudes, where moisture content is low. While the air is clean, the dryness is bad for sinuses and can break down mucous barriers, making it easier to catch infection. The most common way to pick up a bug when flying is from touching contaminated surfaces tray tables, lavatory doors, and latches on overhead bins, armrests etc which may contain germs.

www.covid-19facts.com		FALSE	The virus that causes COVID-19 is just a mutated version of the common cold	The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says: “The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.	2020-05-28	https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84367
www.covid-19facts.com		FALSE	Coronavirus can only be caught directly from infected people	The WHO advises cleaning hands frequently and thoroughly, using soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitisers as the best way to protect yourself and others against COVID-19. They also advise that handwashing gives you more protection than wearing gloves, as you can still contaminate the gloves, and then transfer this contamination to your face.	2020-05-28	https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84292
www.covid-19facts.com		FALSE	Hand-dryers kill the coronavirus	The WHO says: “Hand dryers are not effective in killing the [novel coronavirus]. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly using paper towels or a warm air dryer.	2020-05-28	https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84292
www.covid-19facts.com		FALSE	Mosquitos can spread coronavirus	The World Health Organisation is quite clear that there is no evidence to date suggesting mosquitos can transmit coronavirus. It says infected droplets from the mouths and noses of people suffering the disease are the key route of transmission and reiterates the recommendation that frequent hand washing is the best way to protect oneself against it.	2020-05-28	https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84126
www.covid-19facts.com		FALSE	Spraying yourself with chlorine or bleach can protect against coronavirus	The World Health Organization says: “Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations.	2020-05-28	https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84120
www.covid-19facts.com		FALSE	Antibiotics are already available to treat COVID-19	The World Health Organization says: “Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

www.covid-19facts.com		FALSE	Red eyes mean you have coronavirus	The NHS continues to state that symptoms of coronavirus infection to look out for are a high temperature and a new, continuous cough. The World Health Organization says: “The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhoea.	2020-05-28	https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84050
www.covid-19facts.com		FALSE	Vaccination against pneumonia might protect you from coronavirus	The World Health Organization states clearly that vaccines against pneumonia don’t protect against COVID-19. It points out that this infection is completely new, and needs a completely novel type of vaccine. Urgent research work is underway to find one.	2020-05-28	https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84042
www.covid-19facts.com		FALSE	Drinking hot water, or gargling, can prevent coronavirus infection	Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health says: “There is no evidence that regularly gargling has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. While this may help soothe a sore throat, this practice will not prevent the virus from entering your lungs—neither will drinking frequent sips of water.	2020-05-28	https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83990
www.covid-19facts.com		FALSE	Taking a sauna or hot bath can kill coronavirus	The World Health Organisation says: “Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you.	2020-05-28	https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83981
www.covid-19facts.com		FALSE	Airport temperature screening for arriving passengers can stop coronavirus	The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has stated that “There is evidence that checking people at the airport (known as entry screening) is not very effective in preventing the spread of the virus, especially when people do not have symptoms. It is generally considered more useful to provide those arriving at airports with clear information explaining what to do if they develop symptoms after arrival.	2020-05-28	https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83757
www.covid-19facts.com		FALSE	Mutations are making coronavirus more aggressive	The researchers themselves say that it is not clear whether the L type causes more severe disease (“is more virulent) than the S type. As yet we have very limited information on the genetics of the circulating viruses, and how genetic variations might impact severity or infectiousness in humans, or in cells or animals in the laboratory.	2020-05-28	https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83749
www.covid-19facts.com		FALSE	Coronavirus is no worse than the flu	Seasonal influenza, pandemic flu (such as H1N1) and SARS, another coronavirus, are natural comparators for these outbreaks, but they are all different diseases with different case fatality rates and profiles.	2020-05-28	https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83734
www.covid-19facts.com		FALSE	Children are safe from coronavirus	The initial research findings have allayed some fears about COVID-19 in children.
