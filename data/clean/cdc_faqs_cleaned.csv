0,A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified,"What is a novel coronavirus? A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the¬†coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans¬†and cause mild illness, like the common cold.
 A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.",CDC,true,CDC,2020-06-12,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html
1,"On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China","Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19? On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization¬†announced¬†an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‚ÄòCO‚Äô stands for ‚Äòcorona,‚Äô ‚ÄòVI‚Äô for ‚Äòvirus,‚Äô and ‚ÄòD‚Äô for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as ‚Äú2019 novel coronavirus‚Äù or ‚Äú2019-nCoV‚Äù.
 There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO)¬†best practiceexternal iconexternal icon¬†for naming of new human infectious diseases.",CDC,true,CDC,2020-06-12,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html
2,Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem.,"Why might someone blame or avoid individuals and groups (create stigma) because of COVID-19? People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals.
 Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
 Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem.",CDC,true,CDC,2020-06-12,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html
3,People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring,How can people help stop stigma related to COVID-19? People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring. Stigma affects the emotional or¬†mental health¬†of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in. Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient. See¬†resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19. Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by¬†knowing the facts¬†and sharing them with others in your community.,CDC,true,CDC,2020-06-12,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html
4,CDC overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions,Why do some state‚Äôs COVID-19 case numbers sometimes differ from what is posted on CDC‚Äôs website?

6,Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase,"Why do the number of cases for previous days increase? Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase. (Sometimes this effect is described as ‚Äúbackfill.‚Äù) State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC. Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late.",CDC,true,CDC,2020-06-12,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html
7,"At this time, we do not think that people with high blood pressure and no other underlying health conditions are more likely than others to get severely ill from COVID-19","COVID-19 and Hypertension Are people with high blood pressure (hypertension) at higher risk from COVID-19?
 At this time, we do not think that people with high blood pressure and no other underlying health conditions are more likely than others to get severely ill from COVID-19. Although many people who have gotten severely ill from COVID-19 have high blood pressure, they are often older or have other medical conditions like obesity, diabetes, and serious heart conditions that place them at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.
 If you have high blood pressure, it‚Äôs critically important that you keep your blood pressure under control to lower your risk for heart disease and strokes. Take your blood pressure¬†medications¬†as directed, keep a log of your blood pressure every day if you are able to take your blood pressure at home, and work with your healthcare team to make sure your blood pressure is well controlled. Any changes to your medications should be made in consultation with your healthcare team.
 Should I continue to take my blood pressure medication?
 Yes. Continue to take your blood pressure medications exactly as prescribed and make lifestyle modifications agreed upon in your treatment plan. Continue all your regular medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), as prescribed by your healthcare team. This is recommended by current clinical guidelines from the American Heart Association, the Heart Failure Society of America, and the American College of Cardiology",CDC,true,CDC,2020-06-12,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html
8,COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2,"What is the source of the virus? COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. ¬†Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people. This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir. However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.
 More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.",CDC,true,CDC,2020-06-12,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html
9,"The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes","How does the virus spread? The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
 COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (‚Äúcommunity spread‚Äù) in¬†many affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.

10,The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country,Why are we seeing a rise in cases? The¬†number of cases of COVID-19¬†being reported in the United States is rising due to¬†increased laboratory testing¬†and reporting across the country. The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread. More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.,CDC,true,CDC,2020-06-12,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html
11,The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person,"Can someone who has had COVID-19 spread the illness to others? The virus that causes COVID-19 is¬†spreading from person-to-person. People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest). That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.
 How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e. time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials. The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.
 Learn more about¬†CDC‚Äôs guidance on when to release someone from isolation¬†and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19. For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see¬†Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19.
 Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.",CDC,true,CDC,2020-06-12,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html
12,"Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease","Can someone who has been quarantined for COVID-19 spread the illness to others? Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.",CDC,true,CDC,2020-06-12,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html
13,Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets,"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be spread through food, including restaurant take out, refrigerated or frozen packaged food? Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
 It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
 In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging.

 If you are unable to stay home with your child during school dismissals, carefully consider who might be best positioned to provide childcare. If someone at higher risk for COVID-19 will be providing care (older adult, such as a grandparent or someone with a serious underlying medical condition), limit your children‚Äôs contact with other people.

Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs. It‚Äôs not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
 Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens. Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition. The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system. This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19.
 More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk. CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed.

In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness¬†and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness.
 
 Identify potential alternative caregivers, if you or other regular caregivers become sick and are unable to care for your child. If possible, these alternative caregivers would not be at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 themselves.
 Try to have at least one month of medication and medical supplies on hand. Some health plans allow for a 90-day supply of prescription medications. Consider discussing this option with your child‚Äôs healthcare provider.
 Review any care plans for your child, such as an asthma action plan, and make sure caregivers and backup caregivers are familiar with these plans.
 If you do not have care plans or an emergency notebook, try to make them. They typically include important information about your child‚Äôs medical conditions, how to manage those conditions, how to get in touch with your child‚Äôs doctors, allergies, information on medications (names, dosages, and administration instructions), preferences (food and other) or special needs, daily routines and activities, friends, and details about routines that are important to support behavioral and emotional health.
 Learn if your child‚Äôs healthcare providers, including doctors and therapists, have new ways to be contacted or new ways of providing appointments. If they offer telemedicine visits, find out how those are arranged and any additional information you need.
 If your child receives any support care services in the home that need to be continued, make plans for what you will do if those direct care providers get sick, or if persons in your household are sick.
 Discuss with the support care agencies and the providers ways to minimize risk for exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19.
 
 If your child or other persons in your household are sick with COVID-19 and are able to recover at home, inform your direct care providers and consider postponing or rescheduling services until the criteria for discontinuing home isolation have been met.
 Ask service providers if they are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19, or if they have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19.
 Tell the service provider to:
 
 Wear a cloth face covering if they will be close (less than 6 feet) to you or persons in your household. Their cloth face covering helps protect you if they are infected but do not have symptoms.
 Ask them to wash their hands with soap and water or, if unavailable, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when they enter your home, before and after helping your child (dressing, bathing/showering, transferring, toileting and/or diapering, feeding), after handling tissues, and after changing linens or doing laundry. Learn more about proper handwashing.

COVID-19 is a new disease and¬†we are still learning how it spreads.¬†The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19. The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.¬†This type of spread is not a concern after death.
 It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
 People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.

Implement sick leave policies that are flexible, nonpunitive, and consistent with public health guidance, allowing employees to stay home if they have symptoms of respiratory infection.
 Consider conducting daily health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees and others visiting the facility before they enter the premises. People with a fever of 100.40(38.00C) or above or other signs of illness should not be admitted to the premises. If implementing health checks, conduct them safely and respectfully. See General Business FAQs¬†for more information.
 
 Employees or visitors who appear to have symptoms upon arrival or who become sick during their visit should immediately be separated from other employees and visitors and sent home.
 
 
 Limit the number of people entering the facility. Consider staggering lesson and visiting times to limit the number of people in the facility and potential for person-to-person contact. If possible, you can also take steps to decrease high-traffic areas by limiting areas open to visitors/owners or staggering use of common areas like grooming or wash stalls and tack rooms.
 Increase distance and limit duration of contact between employees and visitors in the facility. Whenever possible, people should maintain at least 6 feet of distance between each other at the facility, including instructors teaching lessons. Allow for social distancing¬†and avoid large numbers of people within the facility, including in employee-only areas.
 Visitors and employees should wear cloth face coverings to protect others especially where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Wearing a cloth face covering does NOT replace the need to practice social distancing.
 Set up hand hygiene stations at the entrance and within the facility, so that employees and people entering can clean their hands before they enter. Employees should wash hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. An alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol can be used, but if hands are visibly dirty, they should be washed with soap and water before using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Examples of hand hygiene stations may be a hose and soap located at entrances to allow for handwashing before entry.

108,"Individuals, communities, schools, businesses and healthcare organizations all have a role to play in community mitigation","Who is involved in community mitigation actions? Individuals, communities, schools, businesses and healthcare organizations all have a role to play in community mitigation. Policies*, which include limits on large gatherings, restrictions on businesses, and school closures are often needed to fully put in place community mitigation strategies.
 Each community is unique. Because some actions can be very disruptive to daily life, mitigation activities will be different depending on how much disease has spread within the community, what the community population is like, and the ability to take these actions at the local level. To identify appropriate activities, all parts of a community that might be impacted need to be considered, including populations most vulnerable to severe illness, and those who might be more impacted socially or economically. When selecting mitigation activities, states and communities need to consider the spread of disease locally, characteristics of the people who live in the community (for example, age groups, languages spoken, overall health status), and the kind of public health resources and healthcare systems (like hospitals) that are available in the community. State and local officials may need to adjust community mitigation activities and immediately take steps to scale them up or down depending on the changing local situation.
 Putting mitigation into practice is based on:
 
 Emphasizing individual responsibility for taking recommended personal-level actions
 Empowering businesses, schools, and community organizations to take recommended actions, particularly in ways that protect persons at increased risk of severe illness
 Focusing on settings that provide critical infrastructure or services to individuals at increased risk of severe illness
 Minimizing disruptions to daily life to the extent possible
